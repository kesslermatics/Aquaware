# Create an Environment

## What is an Environment?

In **Aquaware**, an environment represents a water system or setting you want to monitor. Examples of environments include aquariums, lakes, pools, seas, or even ponds. Each environment stores essential data such as water parameters and metadata, enabling you to keep track of its condition and make data-driven decisions.

## Understanding the Environment ID

Each environment you create has a unique **ID**. This ID is used to identify the environment across Aquaware's systems. It’s especially important if you’re using the API to upload water values or automate processes. The ID can be found in the environment card under "ID."

There is no limit to the amount of environments but the amount of which you can upload to is set to your plan's limit

Let's now look into how we can start adding our water values to aquaware.
