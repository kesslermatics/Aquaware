# Setting Up Your Aquaware Hardware Kit  

Congratulations! Your Aquaware hardware kit is ready for setup. In just a few simple steps, you can start monitoring your water quality.  

## 1. Prepare the Hardware  

Submerge the sensors in water and connect the hardware kit to a power source via USB. After a short time, a Wi-Fi network named **"Aquaware_Setup"** will appear.  

Connect to this network â€“ the default password is **"12345678"**.  

## 2. Connecting & Configuration  

Once connected, a configuration page should open automatically. If it does not, you can manually access it via **"http://192.168.4.1"**.

You will need to enter the following information:  

- **WIFI Name** â€“ The name of your Wi-Fi network that the device should connect to.  
- **WIFI Password** â€“ The password for your Wi-Fi network.  
- **API Key** â€“ You can find this after registering in your [Aquaware Dashboard](https://dashboard.aquaware.cloud/account) under **Account Settings**. Copy the API key and paste it here.  
- **Environment ID** â€“ This can be found under [Environments](https://dashboard.aquaware.cloud/environments) in your dashboard. If you have already created an aquarium, you will see an ID (a number) above its name. Enter this number here.  

Once all fields are filled in, click **"Save"**.  

## 3. You're all set!  

If all information is correct, the sensor will now automatically send your water data to Aquaware.  

ðŸŽ‰ Great! You're done! Now you can monitor your water values anytime using our official app.
