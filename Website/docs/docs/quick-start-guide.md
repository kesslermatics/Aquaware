### Create an Aquatic Environment

Once you're set up, it's time to create your first aquatic environment! It doesn't matter if it's a small aquarium, a pond, a lake, or even a puddle. You can monitor any water body with Aquaware.
Simply create your environment within the app, and you'll receive an **Environment ID**.

### Upload Your Water Values

Using your Environment ID, you can now start uploading water values such as pH, temperature, or any other relevant parameters.
Ready to get started? Follow the documentation to learn how to [Add Water Values](./add-water-values-).
