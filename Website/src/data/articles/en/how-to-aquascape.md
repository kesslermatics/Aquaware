## What Is Aquascaping?
Aquascaping is the art of designing an aquarium like a living underwater landscape. Inspired by nature, aquascapers create stunning scenes using plants, rocks, and wood. It's not just a hobby but also a form of creative expression that transforms your aquarium into a true work of art.

### Why Aquascape?
- **Aesthetics**: A well-designed aquarium is a centerpiece in any room.
- **Relaxation**: The process of creating and the final result are soothing.
- **Connection to Nature**: It brings a slice of nature into your home.

## The Basics of Aquascaping
### 1. Planning Is Key
Before you start, sketch an idea or look for inspiration. Think about which plants, rocks, and wood you'll use and how they will work together.

### 2. The Right Substrate
A good substrate supports plant growth and forms the foundation of your design. Use a layer of nutrient-rich soil covered with fine gravel or sand.

### 3. The Hardscape
The hardscape consists of rocks and driftwood that form the structure of your layout. Follow the **golden rule of thirds** to create a balanced composition.

### 4. Choosing Plants
Select plants that fit your design and lighting conditions. Fast-growing plants are great for beginners as they help prevent algae.

## Tips for Getting Started
- **Keep It Simple**: Start with a small layout and a few plants.
- **Maintenance Matters**: Regular trimming and monitoring water parameters are essential.
- **Be Patient**: A successful aquascape takes time to grow and mature.
